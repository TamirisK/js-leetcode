# 1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs

The **product difference** between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a _ b) - (c _ d).

- For example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 _ 6) - (2 _ 7) = 16.

Given an integer array nums, choose four **distinct** indices w, x, y, and z such that the **product difference** between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is \*maximized\*\*.

Return the **_maximum_** such product difference.
